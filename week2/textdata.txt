From August to September 2012, a series of anti-Japanese demonstrations were held across more than 100 cities in China.[1] The main cause of the demonstrations was the escalation of the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands dispute between China and Japan around the time of the anniversary of the Mukden Incident of 1931, which was the de facto catalyst to the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, culminating in a humiliating Chinese defeat and a decisive Japanese victory vis-Ã -vis total consolidation and annexation of Manchuria. Protesters in several cities later became violent and local authorities began arresting demonstrators and banning the demonstrations.
